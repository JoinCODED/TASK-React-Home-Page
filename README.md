### Frontend

Create a home page for your website.

#### Setup

1. Choose a theme for your shop. Here are some examples: restaurant, bakery, pharmacy, bookstore, etc.
2. Create your React app:

    ```shell
    $ npx create-react-app <app-name>
    ```
3. Go to [Github](https://github.com/new) and create a new repository for your shop.
4. Initialize your repository locally, then push it to your new repository. 

#### Home Page

1. In `App.js`, remove the logo import at the top and delete all the JSX inside the return.
2. Give your website a title, a description and add an image.
3. Change the images' dimensions if needed. 
4. Center your title and description.
5. You don't have to stick to our design. Be creative!

#### Website Name and Icon

At the moment, your website's tab looks like this:
